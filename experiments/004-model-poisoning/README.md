# Experiment 004: Model Poisoning Detection

## Objective
Detect and analyze model poisoning attacks where malicious behavior is embedded within model weights or architecture.

## Background
- Models can be poisoned during training (data poisoning)
- Models can be modified post-training (weight manipulation)
- Backdoors can be embedded that activate on specific triggers
- Supply chain attacks through model repositories

## Attack Vectors

### 1. Training-Time Poisoning
- Malicious data injection
- Gradient manipulation
- Backdoor triggers

### 2. Post-Training Manipulation
- Weight modification
- Architecture changes
- Metadata injection

### 3. Supply Chain Attacks
- Repository compromise
- Model replacement
- Version hijacking

## Detection Methods

### 1. Statistical Analysis
- Weight distribution analysis
- Activation pattern monitoring
- Output consistency checks

### 2. Behavioral Testing
- Trigger detection
- Adversarial input testing
- Performance anomaly detection

### 3. Provenance Verification
- Checksum validation
- Signature verification
- Training audit logs
