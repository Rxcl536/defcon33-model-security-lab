# Experiment 002: PyTorch JIT Exploitation

## Objective
Analyze security vulnerabilities in PyTorch's TorchScript (JIT) compiled models and demonstrate safe loading practices.

## Background
- TorchScript models (.pt, .pth) can contain serialized code
- JIT compilation allows embedding of custom operators
- Models can include arbitrary Python code via scripting

## Experiment Components

### 1. TorchScript Analysis
- Examine .pt file structure
- Identify code execution vectors
- Compare scripted vs traced models

### 2. Exploitation Vectors
- Custom operators with side effects
- Scripted functions with embedded logic
- Model metadata manipulation

### 3. Detection & Prevention
- Static analysis of TorchScript bytecode
- Sandboxed model loading
- Verification of model signatures
